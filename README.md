For demonstration puroposes, the repository contains uncompressed and unadulterated development versions of the following third-party components:

1. Twitter Bootstrap Version 3.3.7
2. jQuery 1.12.4
3. HTML5 Shiv 3.7.3
4. Respond.js

This is an explicit implementation of a navigation menu for mobile devices. The primary functionality is designed for screen widths of 600px or less. The menus are responsive to larger screen widths, though you might have to do some tweaking.

To customize the menu items, open php/menu.php and customize the $menu array, following the same structure. The PHP script will automatically display text keys in lowercase and with underscores as capitalized strings with spaces. i.e "my_menu_item" becomes "My Menu Item".
